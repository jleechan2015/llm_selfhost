# 🚀 Tool-Enabled Claude CLI with Vast.ai - Deployment Guide

## Architecture Overview

The refactored system now uses a **unified tool-enabled architecture**:

- **`claude_tools_base.py`** - Base classes for all tool implementations
- **`vast_tools_proxy.py`** - Tool-enabled vast.ai proxy (inherits from base)
- **`cerebras_tools_proxy.py`** - Tool-enabled Cerebras proxy (inherits from base)
- **`local_tools_proxy.py`** - Tool-enabled local proxy (inherits from base)
- **`claude-vast`** - Auto-deployment script for vast.ai

## ✅ Verification Complete

All components tested and verified:

### Core Components ✅
- [x] `vast_tools_proxy.py` imports successfully
- [x] `claude_tools_base.py` imports successfully
- [x] Tool execution (bash, file operations) working
- [x] Health endpoints responding correctly
- [x] Inheritance hierarchy functioning properly

### Deployment Scripts ✅
- [x] `claude-vast` script updated for new architecture
- [x] `startup_llm.sh` references correct proxy
- [x] All required files included in deployment
- [x] Help text shows correct file dependencies

### Tool Capabilities ✅
- [x] Bash command execution with security checks
- [x] File creation (`str_replace_editor`)
- [x] File editing and manipulation
- [x] Tool pattern matching and extraction
- [x] Consistent tool execution across all proxies

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

### Option 1: Vast.ai (Recommended for Production)

```bash
# 1. Configure your vast.ai instance details
export VAST_SSH_HOST="ssh7.vast.ai"
export VAST_SSH_PORT="12806"
export VAST_USER="root"

# 2. Deploy and run (automatic deployment)
./claude-vast -p "Create a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"

# The script will automatically:
# - Deploy vast_tools_proxy.py + claude_tools_base.py to your instance
# - Start the Ollama server with qwen3-coder model
# - Set up SSH tunnel
# - Configure Claude CLI environment
# - Execute your prompt with full tool support
```

### Option 2: Cerebras Cloud (Fastest Setup)

```bash
# 1. Set your API key
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# 2. Start proxy
python3 cerebras_tools_proxy.py

# 3. Configure Claude CLI
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8002"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="dummy"

# 4. Test tool execution
claude -p "Run the command 'ls -la' and create a file called test.txt"
```

### Option 3: Local with LM Studio

```bash
# 1. Start LM Studio and load a model

# 2. Start proxy
python3 local_tools_proxy.py

# 3. Configure Claude CLI
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8001"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="dummy"

# 4. Test tool execution
claude -p "Create a simple Python script and run it"
```

## 🔧 Tool Execution Examples

All proxies now support the same tool execution patterns:

### Bash Commands
```
User: Run the command "ps aux | grep python"
Claude: I'll run that command for you.

```bash
ps aux | grep python
```

[Tool executes automatically and shows results]
```

### File Operations
```
User: Create a file called hello.py with a simple hello world program
Claude: I'll create a hello.py file with a simple hello world program.

```bash
cat > hello.py << 'EOF'
print("Hello, World!")
EOF
```

[File is actually created on the system]
```

### Combined Operations
```
User: Create a Python script, make it executable, and run it
Claude: I'll create a Python script, make it executable, and run it.

```bash
cat > script.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
print("Script executed successfully!")
EOF
```

```bash
chmod +x script.py
```

```bash
./script.py
```

[All commands execute in sequence with real output]
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Command filtering**: Dangerous commands like `rm -rf /` are blocked
- **Timeouts**: Commands timeout after 30 seconds
- **Length limits**: Commands limited to 1000 characters
- **Safe defaults**: No access to cloud metadata endpoints

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Backend | Setup Time | Cost/Hour | Model Size | Tool Support |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **Vast.ai** | ~3 min | ~$0.50 | 30B (qwen3-coder) | ✅ Full |
| **Cerebras** | ~30 sec | Pay-per-token | 480B | ✅ Full |
| **Local** | ~1 min | Free | Variable | ✅ Full |

## 🎯 Ready for Production

The architecture refactor is complete and ready for production use:

- ✅ **Unified codebase**: No more duplicate tool implementations
- ✅ **Guaranteed tool support**: All proxies have identical capabilities
- ✅ **Easy maintenance**: Single source of truth for tool logic
- ✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools or backends
- ✅ **Well-tested**: Comprehensive test suite passing

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Choose your backend** (vast.ai recommended for production)
2. **Run the deployment command** 
3. **Start using Claude CLI with full tool execution**
4. **Scale as needed** - all backends support the same capabilities

The system now delivers on the original promise: **cost-effective Claude CLI with full tool execution capabilities**.
