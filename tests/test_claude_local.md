# LLM Test: Claude-Local Integration

**Test Type**: End-to-End LLM-Driven Integration Test  
**Target**: LM Studio Integration via claude-local  
**LLM Intelligence**: File creation, content generation, validation, cleanup  
**Duration**: ~3-5 minutes  

## Test Overview

This test validates the complete claude-local ‚Üí LM Studio integration pipeline by having the LLM:
1. Create a Python script with specific functionality
2. Validate the script was created correctly 
3. Execute the script to prove functionality
4. Clean up test artifacts

**Success Criteria**: 
- ‚úÖ LM Studio connectivity established
- ‚úÖ LLM successfully creates requested files
- ‚úÖ File content matches LLM intent
- ‚úÖ Script execution works as expected
- ‚úÖ Cleanup completes successfully

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure LM Studio is running with qwen3-coder-30b loaded
# Server should be enabled on port 1234
# WSL should be able to reach Windows host
```

### Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test_claude_local.sh - Automated test runner

echo "üß™ Starting Claude-Local Integration Test"
echo "========================================"

# Test 1: Basic Connectivity
echo "üì° Testing claude-local connectivity..."
if ! ./claude-local --help >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚ùå claude-local command not working"
    exit 1
fi
echo "‚úÖ claude-local command available"

# Test 2: LLM-Driven File Creation Test
echo "ü§ñ Running LLM intelligence test..."
./claude-local "Create a Python script called 'test_calculator.py' that contains a Calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, and divide methods. Each method should take two numbers and return the result. Also add a main section that demonstrates all four operations with the numbers 15 and 3. Make sure to include proper error handling for division by zero."

# Validate file was created
if [ ! -f "test_calculator.py" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå LLM failed to create test_calculator.py"
    exit 1
fi
echo "‚úÖ LLM successfully created test_calculator.py"

# Test 3: Content Validation
echo "üîç Validating LLM-generated content..."
if ! grep -q "class Calculator" test_calculator.py; then
    echo "‚ùå Calculator class not found in generated file"
    exit 1
fi

if ! grep -q "def add" test_calculator.py; then
    echo "‚ùå Add method not found in generated file"
    exit 1
fi

if ! grep -q "def subtract" test_calculator.py; then
    echo "‚ùå Subtract method not found in generated file"
    exit 1
fi

if ! grep -q "def multiply" test_calculator.py; then
    echo "‚ùå Multiply method not found in generated file"  
    exit 1
fi

if ! grep -q "def divide" test_calculator.py; then
    echo "‚ùå Divide method not found in generated file"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ All required methods found in generated file"

# Test 4: Functional Validation
echo "‚öôÔ∏è Testing generated script functionality..."
if ! python3 test_calculator.py >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "‚ùå Generated script has execution errors"
    exit 1
fi
echo "‚úÖ Generated script executes successfully"

# Test 5: LLM-Driven Content Analysis
echo "üß† Having LLM analyze its own creation..."
./claude-local "Analyze the test_calculator.py file you just created. Does it contain all the requested functionality? List each method and confirm it works correctly. Then show me the output when the script runs."

# Test 6: LLM-Driven Cleanup
echo "üßπ Having LLM clean up test files..."
./claude-local "Delete the test_calculator.py file you created and confirm it has been removed."

# Validate cleanup
if [ -f "test_calculator.py" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå LLM failed to clean up test_calculator.py"
    # Manual cleanup as fallback
    rm -f test_calculator.py
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Manual cleanup performed"
else
    echo "‚úÖ LLM successfully cleaned up test files"
fi

echo ""
echo "üéâ Claude-Local Integration Test PASSED"
echo "‚úÖ LM Studio connectivity: Working"
echo "‚úÖ LLM file creation: Working"
echo "‚úÖ LLM content generation: Working" 
echo "‚úÖ LLM script execution: Working"
echo "‚úÖ LLM cleanup: Working"

## Test Results Log

### Expected LLM Behavior

**File Creation Request Response:**
```
I'll create a Python script called 'test_calculator.py' with a Calculator class containing the four basic operations...

[LLM should provide the actual Python code here]
```

**Content Analysis Response:**
```
Let me analyze the test_calculator.py file I created:

1. Calculator class: ‚úÖ Present
2. add method: ‚úÖ Takes two numbers, returns sum
3. subtract method: ‚úÖ Takes two numbers, returns difference  
4. multiply method: ‚úÖ Takes two numbers, returns product
5. divide method: ‚úÖ Takes two numbers, handles division by zero
6. Main demonstration: ‚úÖ Shows all operations with 15 and 3

Output when run:
15 + 3 = 18
15 - 3 = 12
15 * 3 = 45
15 / 3 = 5.0
```

**Cleanup Confirmation:**
```
I have successfully deleted the test_calculator.py file. The file has been removed from the current directory.
```

## Manual Test Execution

Run the test with:
```bash
cd tests
chmod +x test_claude_local.sh
./test_claude_local.sh
```

Or run individual components:
```bash
# Test basic connectivity
./claude-local --help

# Test LLM intelligence manually  
./claude-local "Create a simple Python hello world script called hello.py, then delete it"

# Verify integration
ls -la *.py  # Should show no test files remaining
```

## Troubleshooting

**LM Studio Not Responding:**
- Check LM Studio server is enabled (Local Server tab)
- Verify model is loaded (qwen3-coder-30b recommended)
- Test Windows firewall allows port 1234
- Check WSL can reach Windows host: `curl http://$(ip route show | grep default | awk '{print $3}'):1234/v1/models`

**LLM Not Following Instructions:**
- Check model temperature settings (should be 0.1-0.3 for precise tasks)
- Verify model has sufficient context length
- Ensure prompts are clear and specific

**File Operations Failing:**
- Check current directory permissions
- Verify Python is available for script execution
- Ensure LLM has access to file system operations

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ **Connectivity**: claude-local can reach LM Studio
- ‚úÖ **Intelligence**: LLM creates exactly what was requested
- ‚úÖ **Functionality**: Generated code executes without errors
- ‚úÖ **Self-Awareness**: LLM can analyze its own output
- ‚úÖ **Cleanup**: LLM properly manages test artifacts

This test proves that the claude-local integration provides full LLM intelligence with local LM Studio execution, maintaining all Claude Code CLI capabilities while running entirely on local hardware.
