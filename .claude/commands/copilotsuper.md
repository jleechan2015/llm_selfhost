# GitHub Copilot Super Command

**Purpose**: Run comprehensive Copilot analysis on multiple PRs using orchestration agents

**Usage**: `/copilotsuper PR1 [PR2 PR3...]` or `/copilots PR1 [PR2 PR3...]`

**Action**: Uses orchestration system (see `orchestrate.md`) to spawn individual agents for processing multiple PRs in parallel with full Copilot analysis and fixes

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Each PR gets its own orchestration agent working simultaneously
- **Complete Isolation**: Each agent uses isolated worktree to protect current work
- **Scalability**: Handle 10+ PRs concurrently (limited only by system resources)
- **Option 3 Architecture**: Uses integrated `copilot.py` with parallel data collection
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Full GitHub comment extraction, test fixing, and CI resolution
- **Automatic Fixes**: Each agent commits and pushes changes to make PRs mergeable
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Skip unnecessary stages when PRs are already clean
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track all agents' progress and aggregate results

## 🔧 Implementation Approach

**🚨 ORCHESTRATION INTEGRATION**: Uses the orchestration system's agent reuse architecture (see `orchestrate.md` for complete details).

**Core Workflow**:
1. **Parse PR Numbers**: Validate and collect PR arguments
2. **Delegate to Orchestration**: Uses `/orchestrate` to spawn individual agents per PR
3. **Agent Reuse Optimization**: Leverages orchestration's 50-80% efficiency gains through intelligent agent reuse
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track all agents via orchestration system
5. **Aggregate Results**: Compile summary from all agent results

**Individual Agent Per PR with Reuse**:
```bash
# Delegates to orchestration system for optimal agent management
for PR in $PR_LIST; do
    /orchestrate "Run copilot analysis on PR #$PR with agent reuse preference"
done
```

**Key Benefits** (via orchestration system):
- ✅ **Agent Reuse**: 50-80% efficiency gains through intelligent reuse
- ✅ **Complete Isolation**: Each PR gets dedicated agent workspace
- ✅ **100% Coverage**: Every PR processed by individual agent
- ✅ **Resource Optimization**: Strategic reuse without compromising quality

→ **See `orchestrate.md`** for complete agent reuse architecture and implementation details.

## 📋 Command Specification

### Input Validation
- **Required**: At least one PR number
- **Format**: Space-separated integers (e.g., `718 719 720`)
- **Validation**: Check PR exists and is accessible

### Process Flow
```
User: /copilotsuper 718 719 720

1. Validate PRs: Check accessibility of 718, 719, 720
2. Delegate to orchestration system (see orchestrate.md):
   - Spawns individual agents per PR with reuse optimization
   - Each PR gets dedicated agent via orchestration system
3. Orchestration handles:
   - Agent reuse optimization (50-80% efficiency gains)
   - Isolated worktree management
   - Parallel execution coordination
   - Progress monitoring
4. Aggregate results from orchestration agents
5. Present comprehensive summary report

→ See orchestrate.md for detailed agent lifecycle and reuse architecture
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Batch PR Cleanup**:
```bash
/copilotsuper 715 716 717 718
# Clean up multiple feature PRs before merge
```

**Release Preparation**:
```bash
/copilotsuper 720 721 722
# Ensure all release PRs are mergeable
```

**Daily Review Cycle**:
```bash
/copilots $(gh pr list --json number -q '.[].number' | head -5)
# Process 5 most recent PRs using convenient alias
```

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

**Performance is managed by the orchestration system** (see `orchestrate.md`):
- **Agent Reuse**: 50-80% efficiency gains through intelligent reuse
- **Parallel Processing**: All PRs processed simultaneously
- **Resource Optimization**: Strategic agent lifecycle management
- **Isolated Workspaces**: Dedicated worktrees prevent conflicts
- **Scalable**: Handle 10+ PRs with optimal resource utilization

→ **See `orchestrate.md`** for complete performance architecture and optimization details.

## 🚨 Safety Features

**Safety is handled by the orchestration system** (see `orchestrate.md`):
- **Branch Isolation**: Absolute branch isolation protocol prevents contamination
- **Agent Isolation**: Each agent works in separate worktree
- **Failure Recovery**: Independent agent execution with fault tolerance
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic workspace cleanup

→ **See `orchestrate.md`** for complete safety protocols and branch isolation details.

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Commands

**Relationship to `/copilot`**:
- `/copilot`: Single PR analysis (runs in current terminal)
- `/copilotsuper`: Multi-PR parallel processing (spawns orchestration agents)

**Synergy with `/reviewsuper`**:
- `/reviewsuper`: Critical architectural review
- `/copilotsuper`: Automated issue fixing
- **Combined workflow**: Review → Fix → Merge

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Command Integration**: Uses orchestration system for all agent management
**Dependencies**: Orchestration system + existing `copilot.py` infrastructure
**Error Handling**: Managed by orchestration system's fault tolerance

→ **See `orchestrate.md`** for complete implementation details, dependencies, and error handling protocols.

## 🎉 Expected Benefits

- **Developer Efficiency**: Process multiple PRs without context switching
- **Merge Velocity**: Faster PR turnaround with automated fixes
- **Quality Assurance**: Consistent application of Copilot suggestions
- **Risk Reduction**: Safe batch processing without affecting current work
