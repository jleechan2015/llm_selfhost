# /commentreply Command

üö® **CRITICAL**: Systematically addresses **ALL** GitHub PR comments, especially **INDIVIDUAL COMMENTS**, with inline replies and status tracking.

## üéØ INDIVIDUAL COMMENT REQUIREMENT

**MANDATORY**: This command MUST reply to every single individual comment, including:
- **Copilot bot comments** - Automated suggestions and feedback
- **CodeRabbit comments** - AI code review feedback
- **Human reviewer comments** - Inline code suggestions
- **Suppressed comments** - Including hidden/collapsed feedback

**Evidence**: PR #864 had 11 individual comments (3 Copilot + 8 CodeRabbit) with ZERO replies - this MUST be prevented.

üö® **CRITICAL WARNING**: Code implementation alone is NOT sufficient. You MUST post direct replies to each individual comment using GitHub API or `gh pr comment` with specific comment references.

## Usage
```
/commentreply
/commentr (alias)
```

## What it does

1. **Detects Current PR**: Gets PR number from current branch
2. **Fetches ALL Comments**: Retrieves inline, general, and review comments
3. **Presents Each Comment**: Shows context and asks for response
4. **Addresses Systematically**: For each comment:
   - Analyze the feedback
   - Implement fix if needed
   - Mark as ‚úÖ DONE or ‚ùå NOT DONE with explanation
   - Post inline reply via GitHub API
5. **Provides Summary**: Lists all comments addressed in chat

## Individual Comment Types (ALL REQUIRED)

üö® **MANDATORY**: Every single individual comment MUST be replied to:

### Primary Sources (MOST CRITICAL)
- **Inline Pull Request Comments**: Line-specific code feedback (ID: 2223812756, 2223812765, etc.)
- **Review Thread Comments**: Comments within PR review discussions
- **Bot-Generated Comments**: Copilot, CodeRabbit, GitHub Actions feedback
- **Suppressed/Collapsed Comments**: Hidden or minimized feedback

### Secondary Sources
- **General Issue Comments**: Overall PR discussion
- **Review Summary Comments**: High-level review feedback

### Examples from PR #864 (FAILURE CASE)
```
‚ùå FAILED: These 11 individual comments received ZERO replies:

Copilot Comments (3):
- #2223812756: "Function reference table shows inconsistent parameter documentation"
- #2223812765: "Table lists all existing test files as using 'Local Playwright'"
- #2223812783: "Test URL format shows port 8081, but other docs use port 6006"

CodeRabbit Comments (8):
- #2223818404: "Primary method section violates tooling standard"
- #2223818407: "Repeats Playwright-first message contrary to CLAUDE.md"
- #2223818409: "Example section should showcase Puppeteer MCP"
- #2223818412: "Contradicts project-wide mandate: Puppeteer MCP must be primary"
- #2223818415: "Function reference table tied to Playwright MCP will become obsolete"
- #2223818416: "Statement enforces Playwright MCP for new tests ‚Äì conflicts with mandate"
- #2223887761: "Fallback hierarchy wording is inverted"
```

**LESSON**: This MUST NOT happen again - every individual comment requires a direct reply.

üö® **EXECUTION REQUIREMENT**: For EACH individual comment, you must BOTH:
1. ‚úÖ **Implement technical fix** (if applicable) - address the actual issue
2. ‚úÖ **Post direct reply** - use `gh pr comment [PR] --body "üìç Reply to Comment #[ID]..."`

**ANTI-PATTERN**: Claiming "100% coverage" after only implementing fixes without posting replies.

## Process Flow

### 1. Discovery Phase
```bash
# Get current PR
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

# Get repository info
OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner -q .owner.login)
REPO=$(gh repo view --json name -q .name)

# Get current commit hash for all replies
CURRENT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null)
if [ $? -ne 0 ] || [ -z "$CURRENT_COMMIT" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: Failed to retrieve the current commit hash. Ensure the repository is in a valid state and not in a detached HEAD state." >&2
  exit 1
fi
echo "Using commit hash for replies: $CURRENT_COMMIT"
```

### 2. Individual Comment Fetching (CRITICAL)
üö® **MANDATORY**: Fetch EVERY individual comment with these specific API calls:

```bash
# 1. Fetch ALL inline pull request comments (PRIMARY SOURCE)
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate

# 2. Fetch review comments from all reviews
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews" --paginate | \
  jq -r '.[] | select(.body != null) | .id' | \
  xargs -I {} gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews/{}/comments"

# 3. Fetch general issue comments
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate

# 4. VERIFY: Aggregate ALL sources and count total individual comments
pull_comments=$(gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate)
issue_comments=$(gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate)
review_comments=$(gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews" --paginate | \
  jq -r '.[].id' | \
  xargs -I {} gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews/{}/comments" 2>/dev/null || echo '[]')

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Error: Failed to fetch pull request comments from the GitHub API." >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Combine and count all comment sources - FIXED: Safe defaults for empty sources
if [ -z "$pull_comments" ] || [ "$pull_comments" = "null" ]; then
  pull_comments='[]'
fi
if [ -z "$issue_comments" ] || [ "$issue_comments" = "null" ]; then
  issue_comments='[]'
fi
if [ -z "$review_comments" ] || [ "$review_comments" = "null" ]; then
  review_comments='[]'
fi

all_comments=$(printf '%s\n%s\n%s\n' "$pull_comments" "$issue_comments" "$review_comments" | jq -s 'add | unique_by(.id)')
total_comments=$(echo "$all_comments" | jq length)
echo "Total individual comments to process: $total_comments"
```

**Key Requirements**:
- **Use `--paginate`** to ensure ALL comments are retrieved
- **Process each comment individually** - no batching or grouping
- **Include bot comments** - Copilot, CodeRabbit, etc. are NOT exceptions
- **Double-check count** - Verify expected number of comments are found

### 3. Response Processing (üö® CRITICAL: AUTONOMOUS GENUINE INTELLIGENCE)
For each comment in autonomous operation:

üö® **MANDATORY SELF-VALIDATION PROTOCOL**:
Before posting ANY response, verify:
1. ‚úÖ **Content Reading**: "Did I read the actual comment.body text from the data?"
2. ‚úÖ **Specific Analysis**: "Does my response address specific technical points raised?"
3. ‚úÖ **Understanding Demo**: "Does my response demonstrate I understood the comment's context?"
4. ‚úÖ **No Templates**: "Am I using genuine analysis, not pattern-based generation?"
5. ‚úÖ **Technical Substance**: "Does my response show technical understanding, not generic acknowledgment?"

**AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOW**:
1. **Load comment data**: Read comment.body from GitHub API directly
2. **Genuine analysis**: Address SPECIFIC technical points raised in each comment
3. **Self-validate**: Apply 5-point validation protocol above
4. **Status determination**: Mark as DONE or NOT DONE with technical substance
5. **Post reply**: Use GitHub API to respond inline with authentic analysis

üö® **FORBIDDEN TEMPLATE PATTERNS**:
- ‚ùå NEVER use `if 'coderabbit' in author: response = template`
- ‚ùå NEVER generate generic acknowledgments without reading comment content
- ‚ùå NEVER execute unauthorized Python code for response generation
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS read each comment's ACTUAL CONTENT before responding
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS provide genuine Claude analysis addressing specific technical content
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS pass self-validation before posting responses

### 4. Individual Comment Reply APIs (CRITICAL) - Enhanced Context Reply System
üö® **MANDATORY**: Reply to EACH individual comment using the ENHANCED CONTEXT REPLY system:

```bash
# METHOD 1: ENHANCED CONTEXT REPLY (OPTIMAL USER EXPERIENCE)
# Creates general comments with rich context - GitHub API limitation workaround
create_enhanced_context_reply() {
  local original_comment_id="$1"
  local response_body="$2"
  local comment_data="$3"

  # Extract context information
  local file_path=$(echo "$comment_data" | jq -r '.path // "N/A"')
  local line_number=$(echo "$comment_data" | jq -r '.line // .original_line // "N/A"')
  local snippet=$(echo "$comment_data" | jq -r '.body' | head -c 100)

  echo "üîÑ Creating enhanced context reply to comment #$original_comment_id..."

  # Enhanced context reply with file, line, and snippet context
  local enhanced_body="üßµ **Reply to Inline Comment #$original_comment_id**"
  enhanced_body+="\nüìÅ **File**: \`$file_path\`"
  enhanced_body+="\nüìç **Line**: $line_number"
  enhanced_body+="\nüí¨ **Original**: \"$snippet...\""
  enhanced_body+="\n\n$response_body"
  enhanced_body+="\n\n*(Enhanced Context Reply System)*"

  # Post as general comment (works reliably vs threading limitations)
  gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "$enhanced_body"

  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ SUCCESS: Enhanced context reply created for comment #$original_comment_id"
    return 0
  else
    echo "‚ùå FAILED: Enhanced context reply failed for comment #$original_comment_id"
    return 1
  fi
}

# METHOD 2: Enhanced Context Verification (CRITICAL)
# Verify enhanced context reply was posted successfully
verify_enhanced_context_reply() {
  local original_id="$1"
  local max_attempts=3

  for attempt in $(seq 1 $max_attempts); do
    sleep 2  # Allow API to process

    # Check if enhanced context reply was posted (look for our unique format)
    ENHANCED_REPLY=$(gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate | \
      jq -r '.[] | select(.body | contains("üßµ **Reply to Inline Comment #'$original_id'**")) | .id')

    if [ -n "$ENHANCED_REPLY" ]; then
      echo "‚úÖ VERIFIED: Enhanced context reply $ENHANCED_REPLY created for comment $original_id"
      return 0
    fi

    echo "‚è≥ Attempt $attempt: Waiting for enhanced context reply verification..."
  done

  echo "‚ùå ENHANCED REPLY FAILED: No enhanced context reply found for comment $original_id"
  return 1
}

# METHOD 3: Fallback System (RELIABILITY) - Basic Context Reply
# If enhanced context fails, create basic comment with clear reference
create_fallback_comment() {
  local original_id="$1"
  local response_body="$2"

  gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "üìç **FALLBACK Reply to Comment #$original_id**:
$response_body
üîó Enhanced context failed - this is a basic comment reference"

  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è FALLBACK: Basic comment created for #$original_id"
}

# METHOD 4: Complete Enhanced Context Workflow (ROBUST)
# Implements enhanced context replies with verification and fallback
reply_to_individual_comment() {
  local comment_data="$1"
  local response_body="$2"

  # Extract comment details
  local comment_id=$(echo "$comment_data" | jq -r '.id')
  local file_path=$(echo "$comment_data" | jq -r '.path // "N/A"')
  local line_number=$(echo "$comment_data" | jq -r '.line // .original_line // "N/A"')

  echo "üîÑ Processing comment #$comment_id with enhanced context..."

  # Step 1: Attempt enhanced context reply
  if create_enhanced_context_reply "$comment_id" "$response_body" "$comment_data"; then
    # Step 2: Verify enhanced context reply worked
    if verify_enhanced_context_reply "$comment_id"; then
      echo "‚úÖ SUCCESS: Enhanced context reply created for #$comment_id"
      return 0
    fi
  fi

  # Step 3: Fallback to basic comment
  create_fallback_comment "$comment_id" "$response_body"
  return 1
}
```

**Critical Notes**:
- **Every single comment gets its own enhanced context reply** - no exceptions for bots
- **Use Enhanced Context Reply System** - provides file/line/snippet context for superior UX
- **Verification mandatory** - confirm enhanced context reply posted via API check
- **Fallback system required** - basic comments if enhanced context fails
- **Include status markers** - ‚úÖ DONE or ‚ùå NOT DONE in every reply
- **Track success rate** - monitor enhanced context vs fallback ratio

## Response Format

Each reply follows this format with **MANDATORY commit hash reference**:
- **‚úÖ DONE**: `‚úÖ DONE: [explanation of fix/change made] (Commit: [short-hash])`
- **‚ùå NOT DONE**: `‚ùå NOT DONE: [reason why not addressed] (Current: [short-hash])`

**Commit Hash Requirements**:
- **ALWAYS include current commit hash** in every comment reply
- Use `git rev-parse --short HEAD` to get 7-character short hash
- Format: `(Commit: abc1234)` for completed changes
- Format: `(Current: abc1234)` for unchanged/declined items

## Individual Comment Summary (MANDATORY)

üö® **CRITICAL**: At the end, provides a comprehensive summary showing EVERY individual comment was addressed:
